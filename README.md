# Analyzing the Toronto Police Annual Crime Report

Abstract: Policing is heavily relied on to ensure order in the city of Toronto, but it is up to the public to decide if they are doing a proper job. We will look at the Toronto Police Service Annual Statistical Report and use data and statistics to aid in the decision making process about dealing with crime in the City. We seek two key factors: the most popular type of crime, and where the most crime occurs, in working out how to lower the crime rate. We will conclude that our findings align with the Toronto Police Service's goals as a police department, which bodes well for Toronto's safety and security.
